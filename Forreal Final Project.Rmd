I was curious how accurate the over/under predictions actually are, so I plotted the over/unders for each game against the total number of points that were scored in that game.  I also separated the graphs between playoff and regular season games to see if there was a difference in the correlation there.
#Test Correlation Between Over/Under and Total Points Scored
```{r}
ggscatter(NFLDataTable, x = "over_under_line", y = "totalpoints", 
          add = "reg.line", conf.int = FALSE, 
          cor.coef = TRUE, cor.method = "pearson",
          xlab = "Over/Under", ylab = "Total Points Scored") +
            aes(color = schedule_playoff) + facet_wrap(~schedule_playoff)
```
As shown in the graph above, there is (unsurprisingly) a positive correlation between over/unders and total points scored, but interestingly, the correlation is substantially stronger in the playoffs compared to regular season games.

I also wanted to check for a correlation between temperature and total points scored.  I figured that there would be a positive correlation, since it becomes harder to throw and catch the ball as it gets colder, but I didn't expect to see a very strong correlation.
#Test Correlation Between Temperature and Total Points Scored
```{r}
ggscatter(NFLDataTable, x = "weather_temperature", y = "totalpoints", 
          add = "reg.line", conf.int = FALSE, 
          cor.coef = TRUE, cor.method = "pearson",
          xlab = "Temperature (F)", ylab = "Total Points Scored") +
            aes(color = schedule_playoff) + facet_wrap(~schedule_playoff)
```
I was very shocked to find that there was actually the slightest negative correlation between the variables during the regular season (although it was close enough to 0 that it was essentially negligent).  This trend did not hold up in the playoffs, though, as there was a low positive correlation there as shown in the graphs above.
